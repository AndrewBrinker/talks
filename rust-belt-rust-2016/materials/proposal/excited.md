I think that the Rust community already has the building blocks for great
documentation. Rustdoc is a wonderful tool that will only continue to improve,
and the language itself takes documentation seriously.

That being said, there is a huge opportunity for improvement in documentation
across the rest of the Rust ecosystem, which I find really exciting. Writing
cumentation is a great way to improve the quality of any crate, and helps to
make code more accessible to newcomers.

One of the great things about programming is that anyone can do it; but
out-of-date, incomplete, or missing documentation puts up a barrier, limiting
the ability of newcomers to contribute. I want more people to not just be
involved in open source work, but to realize how fun and personally rewarding
it can be, and I want to encourage people with skill-sets beyond writing code
to contribute. Putting a spotlight on the ways we as a community can improve
and make it easy for others to help improve our crate documentation is a great
way to accomplish these goals.
